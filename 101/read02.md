# summary

## what is git?
Git is a ***DVCS*** that stores data in an abbreviated file system. Every time you save a modified version of your project called commitment Git creates a file summary and saves the reference to it. If the file is not converted, Git only retains the reference to its already saved version.
**Every change** that has been applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

Data is securely stored in a local database

***` Modified `***

## cloning
you can also clone other files from an existing Git repository from a particular server
by using the URL from GitHub which gives you a copied versions of all files for a project.

## status
you can check the status of your work by typing the comand ***git status*** to check wither your fills has been copied or got changed basically you get a full status about the changes taht you have made.

## terminal 
all this work will be done on the terminal so it would be a good idea to check the basics of how does a terminal work and the commands you can use to create/add and even remove fills.

by using the **ACP** (add commit push) method you can ensure the editing and the status of the work you have done to the copied files

- **git add**: the git command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area and taht you want to update fills.
- **git commit**: for the commit it captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes.
- **git push**: it is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
