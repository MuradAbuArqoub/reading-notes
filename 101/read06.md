# what is CSS?
**CSS** represents ***Cascading Style Spreadsheets*** with an emphasis on "Style." While HTML is used for web document building (defines things like headlines and categories, and allows you to embed images, videos,and other media), CSS comes in and defines your document style page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined by **CSS**. Think of **HTML** as a base (every house has one), and CSS as aesthetic options.

In general, outdoor style sheets are the most effective way to apply CSS to a website (it's easy to track and apply site style from a dedicated CSS file), while in style and medium style sheets can be used in case where every style change needs to be made.
