# **The ABC of programming**
first of all you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in t hree sections: 

**A.** what is code and how do i write one?

**B.** how does computer work with the world around them?

**C.** how do i write a script for a web page?

<div>............................................................................................................................................................</div>

### **What is a script?**

A script is  a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

for writing a script you need a goal first in order to reach you goal.

People can achieve complex goals without thinking too much about them, for example you can drive a car, cook breakfast, or send an email without a detailed set of instructions. But the first time we do these things may seem daunting. So, when we learn a new skill, we tend to break it down into smaller tasks, and we learn to do one at a time. From experience each of these tasks grows familiar and seems simple.

### Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 
 1- mark your goal 
 
 2- design and create a script 

 3- code each part


Computers are very intelligent and obedient. They need to be told all the details of what they are expected to do, and they will do so without question. Because they need different types of damage compared to you or me, everyone who learns to plan makes a lot of mistakes in the beginning. Do not be discouraged.
