## What is a pure function 

Pure functions are the atomic building blocks in functional programming. They are adored for their simplicity and testability.

<br>

## What are the benefits of a pure function?

One of the major benefits of using pure functions is that u can use it instuntly. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments. They also makes maintaining and refactoring code much easier.

## What is immutability?

In object oriented programming, an object is considered as immutable when its state can’t be changed after it was created. The opposite of such an object is a mutable object, which can be modified after its creation.

## What is Referential transparency?

it is the closest subject outside computer science to what we call programming language semantics. The philosopher Willard Quine was responsible for initiating the concept of referential transparency, but it was also implicit in the approaches of Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead.

## What is a module?

The concept of module comes from modular programming paradigm which advocates that software should be composed of separate, interchangeable components called modules by breaking down program functions into modules, each of which accomplishes one function and contains everything necessary to accomplish this.

## What does the word ‘require’ do?

The require() method is used to load and cache javaScript modules. So, if you want to load a local, relative javaScript module into a Node. js application, you can simply use the require() method.

## What do we have to do to make a module available?

first you have to make sure that its enabled,  If the word "Modules" looks grayed out, then it mean that you don't have any content on that page published, Once you have confirmed that your "Modules" button is enabled for your students, then you'll want to check the "Modules" page itself.
