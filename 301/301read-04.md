## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

A controlled component is an component that provides form materials and controls them by keeping form data in the component state. In the controlled part, the data of the form object is managed by the React component and stored in the state of the object.

## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them?

 typically they maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

The event applies to elements with contenteditable enabled, and to any element when designMode is turned on. In the case of contenteditable and designMode, the event target is the editing host. If these properties apply to multiple elements, the editing host is the nearest ancestor element whose parent isn't editable.

## Why would we use a ternary operator?

A ternary operator allows you to assign one value to a variable if the condition was true, and diferent value if the condition is false. A ternary operator makes assigning a value to a variable easier to notice, because it's contains of a single line instead of an if else block.
