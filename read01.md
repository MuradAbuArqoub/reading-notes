## watching:
welp from what i saw get hub is the most direct path for you to create a website for your projects, 
GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud based Git repository hosting service.
it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration, and its user friendly.

##book mark:
well here is almost the same as reading the first artical but its a bit more detailed from more ways to creaete an accessible website
to a ways to interact with the user like:

- [x] meh
- [x] meh
- [ ] meh
