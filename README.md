# Growth mindset

## To briefly sum up the findings
People who believe their talents can be developed 
- with hard work
- good strategies
- and input from others


have a sense of growth. They tend to accomplish more than those with an organized mind 

**those who believe that their talents are innate gifts**

This is because they are less concerned with looking smart and putting more energy into **learning**. 
When all companies embraced the idea of growth, their employees reported that they felt more empowered and committed; they also receive strong organizational support for collaborations and innovations. In contrast, people in organized companies report only one thing: *cheating and deception* among employees, perhaps to profit from the race for talent.
