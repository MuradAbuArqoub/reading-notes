JavaScript can be hard to learn and master and for sure everyone gonna make mistakes working with it. thats why the term debugging came from.

when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors.

debugging isnt easy but thankfuly these days all browsers have a built in debugger, and examine variables while the code is executing.

### **Setting Breakpoints:**

In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.
At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.
After examining values, you can resume the execution of code.

using the ***debugger*** keyword it stops the running time and calls the debugging function.

### **understanding the errors:**

In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.
At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.
After examining values, you can resume the execution of code.

### **how to deal with these errors:**

1- debugging the script to find errors

2- handling errors gracefully

<hr>
The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors by running it to make sure if its working or not.
for the catch it lets you handle the errors
and the throw lets you create custom errors.

### **JavaScript try and catch:**

The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

### **The throw Statement:**

The throw statement allows you to create a custom error.Technically you can throw an exception, If you use throw together with try and catch, you can control program flow and generate custom error messages.

some tips for debugging:

1- Removing or automating all the configuration needed for the application to run. 

2- Donâ€™t fall into the tech stack soup trap.

3- Logging must guide you to find the issue, not drown you with useless details.

4- Handle unexpected situations.

5-Make sure all the external dependencies are explicitly documented.

As long as these recommendations are followed while new features are made or provide maintenance to the system, production support will be much easier, and your company will spend less time and money.bugs and crashes can happen any moment, all that can be make a huge difference.
