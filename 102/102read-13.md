## **local storage vs sessionStorage**

The Web Storage API consists of two modes: sessionStorage and LocalStorage. Both Session Storage and internal storage space separate storage space for each available source during page session.

The main difference between sessionStorage and LocalStorage is that sessionStorage only stores storage while the browser is open including when the page reloads or returns, while LocalStorage continues to store data after the browser is closed. In other words, while data stored in a session is stored when the page is closed, the data stored in local storage is not expired.

### **what is local storage in javaScript?**

localStorage is an asset that allows javaScript sites and applications to save key pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means that the data stored in the browser will continue even if the browser window is closed.

so now you may ask where is this data is stored?

well its stored in google chrome in an SQLite file in a subfolder in the users profile.


### **how does localStorage work?**

- setItem(): Add key and value to localStorage
- getItem(): This is how you get items from localStorage
- removeItem(): Remove an item by key from localStorage
- clear(): Clear all localStorage
- key(): Passed a number to retrieve the key of a localStorage

then using the (getItem) method alows us to get the information that we need to bring the exact method that we called.

and then the (remove) alows us to delete items from this storage and anything that is unnecessary or a local storage unit.

and there is the (key) method that loops through the keys, alows us to pass a number to retreave the number of the key.

localStorage as a type of web storage is an HTML5 specification. It is supported by major browsers including IE8. To be sure the browser supports localStorage, you can check using the following snippet.

### **local storage limitation**

- Do not store sensitive user information in localStorage its a critical matter and can not be risked
- It is not a substitute for a server based database as information is only stored on the browser
- localStorage is limited to 5MB across all major browsers
- localStorage is quite insecure as it has no form of data protection and can be accessed by any code on your web page
- localStorage is synchronous, meaning each operation called would only execute one after the other
