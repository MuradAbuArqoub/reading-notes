## HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is  in the browser window. 

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create powerful HTML:

- JavaScript can replace all HTML elements on a page
- JavaScript can change all HTML attributes on a page
- JavaScript can change all CSS styles on the page
- JavaScript can delete existing HTML objects and symbols
- JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can respond to all existing HTML events on the page
- JavaScript can create new HTML events on the page

## HTML DOM Methods
<div>

DOM methods are actions you can perform on HTML

### The DOM Programming Interface

the DOMs can be accessed using JS, these elements are defind as objects.

There are two ways to select an element from a Nodelist: The item() method and array syntax. Both require the index number of the element you want. 

the item() method is usually used more because its faster.

## the DOM elements:

Often, with JavaScript, you want to manipulate HTML elements

- Finding HTML elements by id
- Finding HTML elements by tag name
- Finding HTML elements by class name
- Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors
- Finding HTML elements by HTML object collections

finding HTML element by Id

The easiest way to find an HTML element in the DOM, is by using the element id.

<div>

**for example:** 

find an element with id="some info idk":

If the element is found, the method will return the element as an object (in myElement).

If the element is not found, myElement will contain null.
