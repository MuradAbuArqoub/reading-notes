## Tables

The table element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

tr: table row

td: table data

There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows (which can contain different content).

These elements help people who use screen readers and also allow you to style these sections in a different manner than the 
rest of the table (as you will see when you learn about CSS).

There are some outdated attributes which you should not use on new websites. You may, however, come across some of them when looking at older code, so I will mention them here. 
All of these attributes have been replaced by the use of CSS.

creating many objects:

Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things. 
Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. 
First, create the template with the object's properties and methods. 

built in objects:

JavaScript sports a number of built-in objects that extend the flexibility of the language. These objects are Date, Math, String, Array, and Object. Several of these objects are "borrowed" from the Java language specification, but JavaScript's implementation of them is different. If you're familiar with Java, you'll want to carefully examine JavaScript's built-in object types to avoid any confusion.

Standard objects by category

- Value properties
- Function properties
- Fundamental objects
- Error objects
- Numbers and dates
- Text processing

window object:

The window object represents the current browser window or tab. It is the topmost object in the Browser Object Model, and it contains other objects that tell you about the browser.
