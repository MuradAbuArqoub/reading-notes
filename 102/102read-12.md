## charts 

The charts are better at displaying data by the appearance of the tables and have the added advantage that no one will press them to use them as an editing tool. It is easy to view and transfer data quickly, but it is not always easy to create.

A good way to get started with charts is Charts, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML canvas element to draw a graph on a page. A well written plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.
