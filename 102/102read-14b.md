## **so what makes a perfect team in googles view?**

Put five, eight, 12 or more people together in a room, and it is a reflection of how well they will work as a team. The larger the group, the more difficult it becomes.

It's very much like eating out with a group of friends. Where to go? Italian? Who ate only vegetables? Steakhouse? Each person has his or her own appetite, which can make creating a “shared interest” a major challenge.

Shared interest is the lifeblood of groups, and only the most successful companies know how to promote it. But how?

This is exactly what Google wanted to learn in 2012, when it first wanted to find out how it was formed by a "complete team." The experiment, led by Abeer Dubey, a manager at Google's People Analytics division, was called "Project Aristotle."

## **the key characterestic of an enhanced team:**

After years of data analysis and discussions from more than 180 groups across the company, Google has found that the types of people (aka one personality) in the group are less relevant.

“We had a lot of details, but there was no indication that a combination of certain personality types or skills or background made a difference. The 'whose' part of the figure seemed indifferent, "Dubey told The New York Times.

Instead, the researchers found that there were five key factors for developing groups:

Psychological security: Everyone feels safe by putting themselves at risk of being surrounded by members of their team, and that they will not be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
Confidence: Everyone completes quality work on time.
Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what to expect. These expectations should be challenging but achievable.
Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, family support, helping the team succeed, etc.).
Impact: Everyone recognizes that the outcome of their work actually contributes to the goals of the organization as a whole.

## **Left brained vs. right brained personalities:**

A simple way to look at this is through the “left brain vs. right brain” theory, which goes that everyone has a dominant side of the brain (the right or the left), and it determines their personality, thoughts and behavior.

Left brained people, on the contrary, are more rational, analytical and purposeful. unlike good people, who tend to think in terms of visions, the left brain are detailed and designed for reality, and they prefer to think in words and numbers. They are more pragmatic. while the skills and features of the left brain can separate donors individually, they are simply table poles.

Right brained people are said to be more intuitive, creative, free thinking and have the ability to collaborate and connect. They are the relationship builders, and they are vital to a team’s success.
