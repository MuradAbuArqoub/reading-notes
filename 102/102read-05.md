## images:

a single picture can be replaced for a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average looking site and a really engaging one.

To add an image into the page you need to use an (img) + <> element. This is an empty element.

<img src="https://coub-anubis-a.akamaized.net/coub_storage/coub/simple/cw_timeline_pic/bfd0c6ebe38/7e9111296447a93f9ed4d/med_1572964269_image.jpg" alt="this is fine" title= "this not fine"/>

src: to add the image u start with the src tag to display it 

alt: is for alternative which will be displayed if the image is not working for some reason

 <img src="htt" alt="this is fine" title= "this not fine"/>

title: to provide additional information about the image.

3: in the middle of a paragraphthe.
