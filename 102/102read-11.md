## images

You can control the image size using layouts and width and height in CSS, just as you can with any other box. Specifying image sizes helps pages to load smoothly because HTML and CSS code will usually load before images, and telling the browser how much space you should leave the image allows us to render the entire page without waiting for the image to download.

### how to center an image?

by default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block.

you can use either text align center or margin auto.

you can even add images as a background, by attaching the URL to the background command.

repeat: now the image will repeat horizontally and vertically.

no-repeate: the image will show up only once.

fixed: The background image stays in the same position on the page.

scroll: the image will follow as u scroll down.

and ofc you can possition your image where ever u want to.
