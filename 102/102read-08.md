## **Layouts**

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block level box or an inline box.

### **containing elements:**

If one block element sits inside another block element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element for the inner containter.

### **controling the position of the elements:**

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control 
the layout of a page: normal flow or static, relative positioning, and absolute. there are some other types of postioning but those count as the main structer for building elements inside of another elements.

positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. you can also float elements using the float property.

**1-normal (static) positioning:**

In normal flow, each block level object remains above the next. Since this is the default way for browsers to handle HTML objects, you do not need CSS material to indicate what objects should appear in normal flow

**2- relative positioning:**

The relative position moves an object in relation to what is the normal flow. For example, you can move it by 10 pixels less than it would be a normal flow or 20% to the right. You can indicate that the element should be located somewhere using position property with a relative value

**3- absolute positioning:**

When the position property is given the full value, the box is removed from the normal flow and no longer affects the position of other objects on the page. its like they are not even there, The features of the unused box (top or bottom and left or right) specify where the item should appear in relation to its contents. In this example, the title is placed at the top of the page with 500 pixels from the left margin. Title width is set to 250 pixels wide. Extensive material has also been used in (p) objects in this example to prevent text from being cracked and unreadable.

<hr>

we can use something called z-index to overlap some of the objects over each others.

float: The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.

to clear a float:
The clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or right hand sides of a box.

we also use margin, width and flaot to create a good looking layout for our projects and much much more other ways.
