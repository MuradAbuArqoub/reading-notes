## **ordered lists**
**(ol):** The (ol) tag defines an ordered list. An ordered list can be numerical or alphabetical. The (li) tag is used to define each list item. Tip: Use CSS to style lists.

**(li):** The (li) HTML element is used to represent an item in a list.

## **unordered lists:**
The unordered list is created with the (ul) element.

Each item on the list is marked between the opening tag (s) and the closing tag (s).

(dl)
The list of definitions is composed of the element (dl) and usually consists of a series of words and their meanings Within the object (dl) you will usually see pairs of objects (dt) and (dd).

(dt)
This is used to contain a defined word.

(dd)
This is used to contain a description.

### **Neasted Lists**
    
    You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.

    Browsers display an integrated list that is intended to override the parent list. In the unused uncollected list, the browser will usually change the character point style.

    By default the box is large enough to hold its contents. To set your size in a box you can use structures for height and width.
The most popular ways to determine the size of a box is to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have become a popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.

If you use a percentage, the size of the box is related to the size of the browser window or, if the box is inserted inside another box, it is a percentage of the size of the box it contains.

When using ems, the size of the box depends on the size of the text inside it. Designers have recently begun to use multiple percentages and ems to measure as they try to create flexible designs on devices with screens of different sizes.

In the example on the right, you can see that an object containing (div) is 300 pixels wide and 300 pixels high. Within this is a 75% width and height of the content.
This means that the maximum size is 225 pixels wide and 225 pixels high.

### **Limiting height:**

Some page designs are expandable to match the screen size of the user. In such designs, the wide specifies the smallest box that can be displayed when the browser window is small, and the max-width property shows the maximum width box that can be stretched until the browser window is wide.

These are the most helpful places to ensure that page content is visible especially on small screens for mobile devices. For example, you can use a max-width asset To ensure that text lines do not appear too wide inside a large browser window and you can use min-width asset to ensure that they do not appear too thick.

## **overflowing content**
you either hid which crops it or hide it it then appears when you scroll you create a class in the css then you call the class in the html file

## **border, margin & padding**

1- border: it creates a box around the text
2- margin: it sets on the edgys of the boxs
3- padding: sets between the box and the words

same thing with the overflow you create a class in the css then you call it in the html.

plus you can add different kind of styles for the boxs and collors
 <hr/>

 for the padding you can extend the sides of it making it a bit higher and lower etc.

 padding-top

 padding-right

 padding-bottom

 padding-left

<hr/>

The margin property controls the gap between boxes.

its commonly given in pixels.
<hr>

for the work you have in the body you can centerlize it using the code: (text-align: center;)

in the css.
